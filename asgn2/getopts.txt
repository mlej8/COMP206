getopts
First receives a list of single characters which represent options. If these characters are followed by a column, it is expected to be followed by an argument which is passed to the script in the $OPTARG variable.
The second parameter is the name of a variable which will be the character of current switch. Hence, each parsed option is second argument

It will stop parsing on the first non-option argument (a string that doesn't begin with a hyphen (-) that isn't an argument for any option in front of it).
It will also stop parsing when it sees the --, which means end of options


If the very first character of the option-string is a :, getopts switches to "silent error reporting mode".
